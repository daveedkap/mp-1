                            Hi! This is my achievements section of my resume! I want to largely dedicate this page to my experience as a 
                            violinist! Sadly, I don't play as often anymore, but as a kid, from the age of 5 years old up until 15 years old, I was
                            playing the violin professionally. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I took interest in the violin as my dad has been playing the instrument his whole life. I began taking private violin lessons
                            outside of school and dedicating hours upon hours every week trying to excel at the instrument. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At some point, I decided to begin applying to orchestra's as I wanted to showcase my talent outside of local recitals.
                            Funny enough, I applied to BYSO (Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra), and got in! Not knowing that's where I'd be attending university
                            in the future.. We performed as various beautiful venues and I grew more and more comfortable performing on stage.
                        </p>
                        <p> That's my achievement of professionally playing the violin for the majority of my life! I still pick up the violin every now and
                            then as I never want to lose the skill I spent so long developing.
                        </p>
