                            Hi! My Name is David Kaplansky. I'm a student here at Boston University and I'm studying Computer Science
                            with a minor in General Studies as I was apart of the CGS (College of General Studies) program with BU. I'm
                            passionate in back-end, web, and iOS development, and I've gained many experiences at corporate jobs to try and
                            hone in on these skills. 

                            Fun fact about me is that I speak Ukrainian and German!
                        </p>

                    <p>

                        along with many other things such as my <strong>Certifications</strong>, <strong>Achievements</strong>, <strong>Projects</strong>, and <strong>References</strong>. Thanks for stopping by!
