                        <p>
                            Hi! This is my experiences page, specifically listing experiences relevant to my career aspirations of becoming
                            a Software Engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the start of my college career I knew I wanted to gain familiarity in working in the industry as a software engineer
                            before actually graduating. This is why last summer I worked at my first internship at CarGurus as a Backend Software Engineer!
                            Beyond all of the technical expertise I gained, I had an amazing time getting to know my team as well as all of the other
                            interns who were apart of CarGurus' internship program that year.
                        </p>
                        <p> This was my first internship experience, however, since then, I've continued to work in the industry as both a Web Developer at
                            a Boston-based Insurance Firm, and as a iOS Swift Developer at Nasdaq! I've been working at both companies throughout the current
                            and previous semester, working part-time at both, and I've been loving it!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've never worked as a Web Developer or iOS developer before, so both roles were incredibly fascinating and new to me which has allowed
                            me to learn so much information over the past few months. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And that's it! Before working at CarGurus, I did actually work as a Scooper at a local ice cream joint in Boston, called J.P. Licks. And, before that,
                            I worked as a Crew Member at Chipotle!
