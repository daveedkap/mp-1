                            Hi again! Like I said earlier, I'm a student at Boston University and I'm a junior. I'm currently
                            studying Computer Science and I will also graduate with a minor in General Studies as I was apart of the 
                            BU CGS program until last year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am expected to graduate in May of 2026 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in General Studies.
                            Currently, I'm commuting to school so I've never actually lived on campus as of now. However, when I am on campus,
                            I love walking through the busy streets of Commonwealth Ave.
                        </p>
