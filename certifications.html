                            Hi! I see you've stumbled into my certifications page. Sadly, I don't have any certifications yet, but I am
                            planning on getting my certification in AWS and overall enhance my knowledge in the world of Cloud. I'm currently
                            taking a Udemy course at my current work in order to hopefully pass the certification test and become AWS certified!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, I want to take some LinkedIn certification tests as I'm seeing more and more people at Boston University
                            post about them on their LinkedIn profile, however, that seems less important to me as of current.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's it! Clearly I'm not the most certified individual but check out my experiences page and maybe that will change
                            your mind on whether you think I am a competent engineer.. haha
                        </p>
